# Advent of Code

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8 - some solutions might work with less, but no guarantees.
- I usually try to use the standard library as much as possible, no external
  libraries should be required - but again, no guarantees.
  
## Usage

```console
python3 <year>/<day>.py < input.txt
```
